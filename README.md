# Project-Spearhead
A machine learning experiment, based on the code of 'Desert Eagle'. The project implements 2 different algorithms of building and training a neural network (using neuro evolution) to play the game.

One algorithm is the vanilla algorithm, which is based on a fixed topology neural network,
trained in a procces of mutation.

The second algorithm is called NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies), and is
based on an augmenting topology neural networks, which train via mutation, but also by
breeding. More on the subject :
